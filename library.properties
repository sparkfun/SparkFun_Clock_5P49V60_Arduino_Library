sentence=Library that enables all functionality for the SparkFun Clock Generator 5P49V60.
paragraph=The SparkFun Clock Generator 5P49V60 breakout board offers a wide range of customizable frequencies in a wide range of different signal types using a single reference clock. Four (single output) clock outputs can generate frequencies from 1MHz-200MHz and eight (differential output) clock outputs can generate frequencies from 1MHz-350MHz. The frequency's many properties can be manipulated in code via I2C using the SparkFun Arduino Library. The SparkFun Clock Generator also has four banks of programmable memory for the time when it's ready to sit on its' own within the project without a microcontroller.
